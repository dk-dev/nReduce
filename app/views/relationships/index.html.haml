          %i Launching Mid-December

        %p Traction Machine is an nReduce-wide marketplace for teams to help each other and be tangibly rewarded for doing so.

        %p Teams earn "Helpfuls" by assisting other teams.  Teams can use "Helpfuls" to get help on their startup, including:

        %p
          %div 1 - Retweet
          %div 2 - HN Comment
          %div 10 - UI/UX Feedback
          %div 50 - Value Prop Feedback From Target Customer

        %b How it works:
        %ol
          %li An "Asking" Team can spend 10 "Helpfuls" on UI/UX feedback for their new landing page.
          %li A "Helping" Team sees and can accept the request and give them feedback.
          %li The "Asking" Team then sees the feedback and is prompted to confirm whether or not it was helpful. 
          %li If the helpfulness is confirmed, then the "Helpfuls" are transferred to the "Helping" team.

        %p Our goal is that each team can use this daily and that for it to be a great source of value for your startup.

        %h3 Welcome to the nReduce Mentor network!  
        %br/ 
        %p Startups earn the ability to access the mentor network with 1-3 months of hard work on nReduce. Once they earn access they can contact one mentor per week. If you are contacted by a startup for a mentorship, you will receive an email and the startup will appear above. You can then learn about the startup and decide if you would like to mentor them.
        %p If you decide to mentor the startup, you will be notified about their weekly progress and be able to give feedback and advice.  To help you get familiar with the system, we have connected you with team nReduce.
        %br/ 
        %p The window for posting their weekly progress opens at 4pm PST on Mondays and closes at 4 PM PST on Tuesdays.  Once one of your startups posts their after video for the week, you will be notifed by email and a "Give Feedback" button will appear below their startup square. Simply click this button to access their checkin and give feedback.
        %p If it is after 4pm PST on Monday and one of your teams hasn't posted their after video, you will see a "Nudge" button that will send them a message saying that you are waiting to give them feedback.
        %br/ 
        %p If you are mentoring other startups outside of nReduce, you can invite them to join nReduce so that you can mentor all of your startups in one place. Simply click the invite button above and enter their startup name and email to do so.
        %br/ 
        %p Mentorship is essential for startups to succeed and we are very grateful that you are willing to help these great entrepreneurs build amazing companies.
